		<h1>Shalom Center in Need of Hygiene Products</h1>
		<a href="documents/Article-PDF.pdf" target="_blank">PDF Format</a>
		<h2>What is Needed</h2>
		<p>As the new year approaches, many people in Kenosha may enter 2026 without clean clothes or proper hygiene. The Shalom Center, a homeless shelter here in Kenosha, is looking for personal hygiene products for those who may not be able to afford them otherwise. Among these needs are women's and children's body wash, razors, and conditioner. The main priority, however, is <strong>laundry soap in pod form</strong>.</p>
		<h2>How You Can Help</h2>
		<p>With the holiday season fast approaching, you can give any of the products on the Shalom Center's needs list to their warehouse on <em>Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 3:30 PM</em>. Any help is greatly appreciated. You can read more <a href="https://www.shalomcenter.org/needs-list/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		<blockquote>We appreciate all of your help. Happy Holidays!</blockquote>
